# University of Ottawa Digital Design Club (uODD)

The University of Ottawa Digital Design Club is dedicated to helping students learn and apply FPGA programming and digital design skills through hands-on projects and events.

This GitHub repository showcases student projects from the club. All work is preserved here for the community, and students are encouraged to:
- Contribute to existing projects
- Build upon previous work
- Create new additions and features
- Collaborate with peers

By maintaining this archive, we aim to preserve student accomplishments and provide a platform for members to showcase their skills and continue learning from each other's work.
